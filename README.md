# Branded Interactions
An interal prototyping tool that allows clients to manipulate and save a series of screen-based interactions. 

##### Why?
To facilitate the building out the mood and tone of their brand on screen-based interactions.

##### How?
Clients will be able to directly manipulate (using either physical - knobs, faders etc or digital controls - on screen spectrum tools) shapes, speeds, pace, lights of simple objects (and potentially save them out as gifs or videos but maybe not MVP) so they can begin to build out a visual cue for how their brand might play out as a series of interactions.

### Current state
The current version of the tool as been built in prototype form to validate ideas [proposed by Joe](https://docs.google.com/a/ustwo.com/document/d/19qUv0BSxZoihyoiLQi-Y1dvAGcc5_rFYiQIodabg58A/edit?usp=sharing) over the New York 2015 summer. As a result, the tool is currently "dumb"â€”and the interactions defined within the tool must be manually logged or recorded for future use.

### Vision
We'd like to facilitate workshops with clients that allow them explore and solidify directions to build upon in projects. These exercises will probably need to be prefaced with branded interactions in context, to help their understanding of the importance of such an exercise in the first place.

##### Next steps
- Interal interviews with experienced workshop-facilitators. Some of these people include Jason, Yu Jin, Paul G
- Experiment with physical interactions (LittleBits, etc)


### To-do
- [x] Isolated live-updating elements (position, rotation, etc)
- [x] Presets
- [x] Live-updating sliders for spring values
- [ ] Label sliders
- [ ] Context for slider changes (a visual point at the original setting for each)
- [x] Update presets with useful values
- [ ] Update and add in-device examples (menus etc)
- [x] Better custom settings
- [ ] Save, edit, export functionality on custom settings
- [x] Module-out as much as possible
- [x] Condense rest of code (functions, arrays, all that good stuff)
- [ ] Limit or replace horizontal scroll with left/right buttons (on right side)
- [ ] Visualise (and live-update) spring/ease/linear graph (like the [Framer Learn](http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/animation/) examples, or [Simon's link](http://hosted.zeh.com.br/mctween/animationtypes.html))

# Branded Interactions
An interal prototyping tool that allows clients to manipulate and save a series of interactions to begin to build out the mood and tone of their brand through a series of interactions. They will be able to directly manipulate (using either physical - knobs, faders etc or digital controls - on screen spectrum tools) shapes, speeds, pace, lights of simple objects (and potentially save them out as gifs or videos but maybe not MVP) so they can begin to build out a visual cue for how their brand might play out as a series of interactions.


### To-do
- [x] Isolated live-updating elements (position, rotation, etc)
- [x] Presets
- [x] Live-updating sliders for spring values
- [ ] Label sliders
- [ ] Context for slider changes (a visual point at the original setting for each)
- [x] Update presets with useful values
- [ ] Update and add in-device examples (menus etc)
- [x] Better custom settings
- [ ] Save, edit, export functionality on custom settings
- [x] Module-out as much as possible
- [x] Condense rest of code (functions, arrays, all that good stuff)
- [ ] Limit or replace horizontal scroll with left/right buttons (on right side)
- [ ] Visualise (and live-update) spring/ease/linear graph (like the [Framer Learn](http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/animation/) examples, or [Simon's link](http://hosted.zeh.com.br/mctween/animationtypes.html))

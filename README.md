# Branded Interactions
An interal prototyping tool that allows clients to manipulate and save a series of interactions to begin to build out the mood and tone of their brand through a series of interactions. They will be able to directly manipulate (using either physical - knobs, faders etc or digital controls - on screen spectrum tools) shapes, speeds, pace, lights of simple objects (and potentially save them out as gifs or videos but maybe not MVP) so they can begin to build out a visual cue for how their brand might play out as a series of interactions.
